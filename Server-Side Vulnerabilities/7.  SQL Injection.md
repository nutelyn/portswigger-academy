## Lab: SQL injection vulnerability in WHERE clause allowing retrieval of hidden data
This lab contains a SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. When the user selects a category, the application carries out a SQL query like the following:

`SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1`

To solve the lab, perform a SQL injection attack that causes the application to display one or more unreleased products.

### Solve:
1. select on of the category such as `pet`, the url slug will change to `/filter?category=pet`
2. change the url slug into `filter?category=' or 1=1 -- -`
3. lab is solved since it shows everything including the hidden one

## Lab: SQL injection vulnerability allowing login bypass
This lab contains a SQL injection vulnerability in the login function. To solve the lab, perform a SQL injection attack that logs in to the application as the `administrator` user.

### Solve:
1. go to `my account`
2. input username as `administrator' or 1=1 -- -` and random password
3. enter and logged in as administrator
4. lab is solved
