## Lab: Username enumeration via different responses
This lab is vulnerable to username enumeration and password brute-force attacks. It has an account with a predictable username and password, which can be found in the following wordlists:
- [Candidate username](https://portswigger.net/web-security/authentication/auth-lab-usernames)
- [Candidate passwords](https://portswigger.net/web-security/authentication/auth-lab-passwords)

To solve the lab, enumerate a valid username, brute-force this user's password, then access their account page.

### Solve:
1. go to `my account`
2. input a random username and password, login
3. notice the error return a string `Invalid username`, a possible bruteforce to gain a correct username
4. repeat step 2 and capture the request in burp, looks like the body passed are `username=aaa&password=pass`
5. send to intruder, set the payload position to this `username=§aaa§&password=pass`
6. set the payload in `payloads` tab then `start attack`\
   \[optional] setup a grep match in `settings > Grep Match` to grep the `Invalid username` string to be flagged, this step is unnecessary since the result can still be predicted based on the length
7. filter by clicking the tab `length` or `invalid username` (if set) there will be one match of user which has different `length` or `invalid username` flag which in this case is `ajax`
8. the username are now found, input the username into the position, change the `username=aaa` to `username=ajax` and add the payload marker to the password so it looks like this `username=ajax&password=§pass§`
9. set the payload of password in `payloads`, might also looks for the response of wrong password (it's `incorrect password`)
10. start the attack, then the correct password will shows, which is `access`
11. login with `ajax:access` and the lab is solved
## Lab: 2FA simple bypass
This lab's two-factor authentication can be bypassed. You have already obtained a valid username and password, but do not have access to the user's 2FA verification code. To solve the lab, access Carlos's account page.

- Your credentials: `wiener:peter`
- Victim's credentials `carlos:montoya`

### Solve:
1. go to `my account`, try to login, input 2fa
2. notice the slug `/my-account?id=wiener` after a succesful login
3. `log out`, try carlos credentials
4. when 2fa pops up change and visit the slug `my-account?id=carlos`
5. 2fa bypassed, lab is solved
