## Lab: OS command injection, simple case
This lab contains an OS command injection vulnerability in the product stock checker. The application executes a shell command containing user-supplied product and store IDs, and returns the raw output from the command in its response. To solve the lab, execute the `whoami` command to determine the name of the current user.

### Solve:
1. open up any one of the product details
2. there's a `check stock` function, click it, capture the request on burp
3. the request body is `productId=1&storeId=1`
4. on the `storeId` change the value to `storeId=1;whoami` (trial and error in burp repeater)
5. the lab will be solved
